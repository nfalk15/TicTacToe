# TicTacToe
TicTacToe project using Python

I am making a TicTacToe project for oe of my classes using the Tiny Python Game Engine and I am a little bit stuck.
I am pretty new to programming, especially Python. I know java decently well. So simple code that a first year college student
would know would be great even if it isn't the most efficient. Right now, the .append() isn't doing what I want and I am having a bit
of an issue actually drawing the objects. Any help would be appreciated
